# LGN

We attempt to build a Lorentz Group Equivariant Network (LGN); an ML model which respects symmetries in high energy physics, for the task of jet classification.

This work is based on this repository: https://github.com/fizisist/LorentzGroupNetwork

## Abstract
Neural networks which are Lorentz group equivariant are extremely desirable for high energy physics data. In this work, we attempt to build such a model and train it to the task of jet- classification. The model reaches state-of-the-art benchmark performance, in addition to passing a series of physics equivariance tests; suggesting a new realm of experimentation with physics equiv- ariant models.
